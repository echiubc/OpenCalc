## Features

- **Dual Calculator Modes**  
  Toggle between a **Scientific Calculator** and a **Graphing Calculator** with a single click.

- **Scientific Calculator**  
  - Standard arithmetic operations and advanced functions (sin, cos, tan, log, √, exp, etc.).
  - A well-organized keypad with consistent button alignment and visual effects.
  - Right-aligned display for optimal numeric input presentation.

- **Graphing Calculator**  
  - Plot multiple functions simultaneously, each in a distinct color.
  - A custom keypad with function shortcuts including trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponents, and more.
  - Zoom In/Out functionality to adjust the graph scale.
  - Interactive graph canvas that displays coordinates when hovering near a graphed line (cursor "locks" onto the line).

- **Responsive & Modern Design**  
  - Utilizes a Google Font (Roboto) for a clean look.
  - Gradients, subtle shadows, and smooth hover effects provide a polished, contemporary appearance.
  - Consistent alignment of text entry fields, buttons, and the graphing canvas.

## Usage

1. **Switch Modes:**  
   Use the "Switch to Graphing Calculator" or "Switch to Scientific Calculator" button at the top to toggle between the two modes.

2. **Scientific Calculator Mode:**  
   - Use the numeric and operator buttons to input calculations.
   - Use function buttons (e.g., sin, cos, tan, log, √, exp, etc.) for advanced operations.
   - The display is right-aligned to mimic traditional calculator layouts.
   - Click "=" to evaluate your expression or "C" to clear the input.

3. **Graphing Calculator Mode:**  
   - Enter one or more function expressions (one per line) in the provided text area.
   - Use the custom keypad to quickly add functions and symbols.
   - Click "Plot Graphs" to render the graphs on the canvas.
   - Use "Zoom In" and "Zoom Out" buttons to adjust the view.
   - Hover over the graph to see coordinates. When close to a graphed line, a marker and the coordinate values will display next to the cursor.

## Customization

- **Styling:**  
  Modify the CSS section in the `<style>` tag to adjust colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual elements to suit your preferences.

- **Functionality:**  
  The JavaScript code is modular, so you can add more functions or modify the existing ones (e.g., extend the preprocessing function to include additional shorthand operations).
